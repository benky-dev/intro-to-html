      <p>
        I am 24 and live in Ottawa. Graphic Design is my passion among other things. I like to read and play video games and other things that I can not think of at the moment. I want this paragraph to appear longer so I am adding this sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the second paragraph. I am not sure what else to write about. There were many motivational quotes to choose from, but I think if it can't apply to a homeless person then it must not be a very good motivational quote. So something 'keep your chin up'-esque, like simply telling someone that positive thinking will lead to positive outcomes, is:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Generally a no brainer
          </li>
          <li>
            Not always true
          </li>
          <li>
            Would get you rightfully beaten up by a homeless person
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>
