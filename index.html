    <p>
      I am 24 and live in Ottawa. Graphic Design is my passion among other things. I like to read and play video games and other things that I can not think of at the moment.

      This is the second paragraph. There were many motivational quotes to choose from, but I think if it can't apply to a homeless person then it must not be a very good motivational quote. So something simply telling someone that positive thinking will lead to positive outcomes is:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Generally a no brainer
        </li>
        <li>
          Not always true
        </li>
        <li>
          Would get you rightfully beaten up by a homeless person
        </li>
      </ol>
    </p>
